# Unsupervised Machine Learning: Clustering Data Distributions Using EP-Means

## Thank You

- Graciously thank the audience for their time
- Graciously thank SEL for the opportunity for an onsite interview

## Introduction

- Introduce myself
- Introduce the Research Project
    - Generalization of K-Means Clustering
    - Built to function on probability distributions, rather than data points
- Introduce Flight duration data as an example dataset

## Preview

- Examination of the generalized EP-Means method
    - K-Means clustering
    - Declaring Initial Clusters using K-Means++
    - Translation to EP-Means
- Flight Duration Dataset
    - Cleaning
    - Exploration
- Apply EP-Means to the Flight Duration Dataset
- Examine Results
